# Improving Icelandic TTS Voice Quality

The current TTS solutions we tested (OpenAI and Google) produce noticeable non-native accents when speaking Icelandic. Here are several approaches to get higher-quality, more authentic Icelandic voices:

## 1. Specialized Icelandic TTS Providers

### Tiro.is
- Developed specifically for Icelandic by language researchers in Iceland
- Native-quality pronunciation with natural prosody
- Website: https://tiro.is/
- Commercial API available for production uses

### Icelandic Speech Synthesis at University of Reykjavík
- Research project producing high-quality Icelandic voices
- Often licensed for commercial applications
- Contact: https://www.ru.is/

## 2. Fine-Tuning Approaches

### Custom Voice Training
- Platforms like Microsoft Azure allow custom voice training
- Would require:
  - Native Icelandic speaker recordings (3+ hours)
  - Phonetic transcriptions
  - Azure Custom Neural Voice service

### Transfer Learning from AI Music Models
Since you mentioned AI music generation produces better results:

- [Bark TTS model](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark) (by Suno)
  - Supports Icelandic and can be fine-tuned
  - Much more natural prosody than standard TTS
  - Can generate music-like expressive speech

- [XTTS by Coqui.ai](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) 
  - Voice cloning with 3 seconds of reference audio
  - Can be fine-tuned for Icelandic specifically

## 3. Voice Enhancement Techniques

### Post-Processing
- Use SSML tags for better pronunciation of specific words
- Apply prosody modification with tools like Praat
- Fine-tune intonation patterns typical for Icelandic

### Voice Mixing
- Create a composite voice by mixing multiple TTS engines
- Use one for proper pronunciation, another for natural prosody

## 4. Prompt Engineering for Better Results

### For OpenAI TTS:
```python
# Example improved prompt structure
text = """
<speak>
<voice name="echo">
<lang xml:lang="is-IS">
<prosody rate="0.9" pitch="+0%">
Góðan daginn. Þetta er prófun á íslensku talgervli.
</prosody>
</lang>
</voice>
</speak>
"""
```

### Try Different Voice Combinations:
- OpenAI's "Nova" voice with slower rate (0.85-0.9)
- "Fable" voice with specific Icelandic pronunciation guidance
- "Echo" with pitch adjustments to match Icelandic intonation

## 5. AI Music Generation Approach

This approach might give the best results based on your observation:

1. Use [AudioCraft](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft) or [MusicGen](https://huggingface.co/facebook/musicgen-large)
2. Prompt for "Icelandic narration with subtle background" 
3. Include pronunciation guides in the prompt
4. Use speaking style closer to soft singing for better intonation

Example prompt:
```
An Icelandic narrator reading text clearly but with natural prosody, no background music, calm pacing: "Góðan daginn. Þetta er prófun á íslensku talgervli."
```

## Implementation Plan

1. **Short term**: Try Bark TTS model with Icelandic preset
2. **Medium term**: Collect native Icelandic audio samples and fine-tune XTTS
3. **Long term**: Evaluate specialized Icelandic providers like Tiro.is

## Voice Quality Comparison Matrix

| Approach | Pronunciation | Naturalness | Implementation Effort | Cost |
|----------|---------------|-------------|------------------------|------|
| OpenAI TTS | Medium | Medium | Low | Medium |
| Google TTS | Low | Low | Low | Low |
| Bark | High | High | Medium | Free |
| XTTS Fine-tuned | High | High | High | Free/One-time |
| Tiro.is | Very High | Very High | Low | Commercial |
| AI Music Models | Medium-High | Very High | Medium | Varies |

The combination of Bark or fine-tuned XTTS would likely give you the most authentic Icelandic voices without the commercial costs of specialized providers.
