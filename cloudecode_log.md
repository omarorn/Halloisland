# Cloud Code Project Change Log

## 2025-03-07 - Update 4

### Azure and ElevenLabs Integration
- Created implementation for Azure Speech Services with Icelandic support
- Implemented ElevenLabs TTS and Scribe STT capabilities
- Developed test scripts for both services:
  - `test_azure_tts.py` - Azure Speech Services TTS implementation
  - `test_elevenlabs.py` - ElevenLabs voice services implementation
- Added comprehensive n8n workflow for service orchestration:
  - Created intelligent service selection based on quality requirements
  - Implemented automatic fallback mechanism when services are unavailable
  - Added processing nodes for both TTS and STT results
- Created detailed setup documentation in `icelandic_chat_azure_elevenlabs_setup.md`

### Real-time Icelandic Chat System
- Expanded real-time chat plan with n8n workflows
- Integrated all voice technologies explored (OpenAI, local solutions, Azure, ElevenLabs)
- Implemented tiered quality selection system:
  - Ultra quality: ElevenLabs (best pronunciation but more expensive)
  - High quality: Azure Speech Services (good quality with neural voices)
  - Balanced: OpenAI (good all-around performance)
  - Basic/Offline: Optimized local solution (works without internet)
- Created webhook-based architecture for real-time communication
- Added detailed service selection logic in n8n workflow

### System Architecture
- Created comprehensive workflow for voice processing:
  - Audio capture and preprocessing
  - Service selection based on quality and availability
  - Multiple STT and TTS options with fallback capability
  - Results processing and standardized response format
- Added detailed JSON workflow in `n8n-icelandic-voice-workflow.json`
- Designed webhook-based API for integrating with web applications

## 2025-03-03 - Update 3

### Web Interface Setup
- Created alternative web interface using Streamlit and Gradio
- Set up OpenAI API integration with the web interface
- Configured model selection and temperature settings
- Added chat history management
- Launched web UI on port 8502
- Attempted OpenWebUI installation (requires Docker permissions)

## 2025-03-03 - Update 2

### RAG Agent Setup
- Started installing dependencies for RAG agent functionality
- Created unified agent that combines Airtable and RAG functionality
- Set up document database directory structure
- Created Streamlit-based user interface for both agent types

### Architecture Updates
- Created unified_agent.py with multi-agent functionality
- Implemented tabbed interface for Airtable resource management
- Added placeholder for RAG document search functionality
- Prepared for integration with vector database

## 2025-03-03 - Update 1

### Environment Setup
- Created Python virtual environment (`ai-agents`)
- Installed core dependencies:
  - OpenAI SDK (v1.65.2)
  - Requests (v2.32.3)
  - python-dotenv (v1.0.0)
  - Azure Identity (v1.20.0)
  - Other supporting libraries
- Configured environment files for different agents
- Ran successful tests for OpenAI API connectivity

### Airtable Integration
- Analyzed original codebase to understand agent structure
- Created new Airtable agent to replace Asana integration
- Fixed API credential formatting in `.env` files
- Discovered available fields in Airtable structure:
  - Resource Name (Type: singleLineText)
  - Resource URL (Type: singleLineText)
  - Resource Type (Type: singleSelect)
  - Notes (Type: multilineText)
  - Plus additional fields (AiTools, Date Added, etc.)
- Added field validation to ensure required fields are present
- Created test script that successfully added a record to Airtable
- Enhanced system prompt with detailed field information

### Agent Modifications
- Updated code to use explicit API key initialization
- Fixed OpenAI client initialization using newer SDK version
- Added error handling for API calls
- Created detailed field descriptions based on API exploration
- Modified agent code to provide better user guidance
- Fixed encoding issues in shell output

### Documentation
- Created CLAUDE.md with project setup and usage instructions
- Created TODO.md checklist to track accomplished and pending tasks
- Set up this changelog to document ongoing work

### Configuration Management
- Updated environment variable names to standard format
- Fixed environment variable references in code
- Created secure storage for API keys and credentials
- Added configuration for both local and SharePoint agents

### Testing
- Validated OpenAI API connectivity
- Successfully tested Airtable record creation
- Identified and fixed issues with Airtable field naming
- Created diagnostic scripts to validate environment variables

## Next Steps
- Create web front-end for Icelandic chat system
- Implement WebSocket streaming for real-time audio
- Record native Icelandic speaker samples for voice cloning
- Test real-world performance with varying network conditions
- Enhance n8n workflow with error recovery mechanisms
- Optimize audio processing for faster response times
- Integrate Azure and ElevenLabs services with existing UI
