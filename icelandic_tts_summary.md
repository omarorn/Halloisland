# Icelandic Text-to-Speech (TTS) Comparison

This document summarizes the testing of different TTS solutions for Icelandic language.

## Sample Text

We used text from an Icelandic book file (`/home/azureuser/helloiceland/texttovoice/icelandic-book.txt`):

```
Frábært! Ég mun skrifa skáldsögu um þrjár persónur sem umbreyta lífi sínu með því að innleiða 7 venjur árangursríkra einstaklinga í daglegt líf sitt. ...
```

## Test Results

### OpenAI TTS

| Voice | Processing Time | File Size | Quality Observations |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|----------------------|
| alloy | 9.52 seconds    | 634.22 KB | Neutral voice with good pronunciation |
| echo  | 4.74 seconds    | 634.22 KB | Clear, slightly higher pitch |
| nova  | 25.00 seconds   | 624.38 KB | Female voice, smoother intonation |

### Google Translate TTS

| Processing Time | File Size | Quality Observations |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------------|
| 9.54 seconds    | 322.50 KB | Basic quality, recognizably synthesized |

## Comparative Analysis

### OpenAI TTS

**Strengths:**
- Multiple voice options
- Natural-sounding pronunciation of Icelandic characters
- Better intonation and prosody
- Consistent voice quality throughout

**Limitations:**
- Processing time can vary significantly between voices (4.7s to 25s)
- Larger file sizes (around 630 KB for same content)
- Requires API key and internet access

### Google Translate TTS

**Strengths:**
- Smaller file size (about half the size of OpenAI files)
- Free to use through the gTTS library
- Consistent processing time

**Limitations:**
- Only one voice option
- Less natural pronunciation
- More robotic sound quality

## Recommendations

1. **For Natural-Sounding Icelandic TTS:**
   - OpenAI's TTS API with "echo" voice provides the best balance of quality and speed
   - "nova" voice offers highest quality but with longer processing times

2. **For Lightweight Integration:**
   - Google Translate TTS through gTTS offers smaller file sizes
   - Suitable for applications where natural voice quality is less critical

3. **For Production Applications:**
   - Consider specialized Icelandic TTS providers like Tiro.is for maximum authenticity
   - For offline use, specialized Icelandic TTS engines would be required

## Next Steps

To further explore Icelandic TTS options:

1. Test with specialized Icelandic TTS providers like Tiro.is
2. Evaluate Microsoft Azure's Icelandic TTS capabilities
3. Test with longer and more varied Icelandic text samples
4. Compare pronunciation accuracy with native Icelandic speakers
