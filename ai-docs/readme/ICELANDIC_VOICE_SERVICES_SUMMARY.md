# Icelandic Voice Services Comparison

## TTS (Text-to-Speech) Comparison Results

We compared multiple TTS services with Icelandic text samples of varying lengths:

### Services Tested

- **Improved Local TTS** (Optimized local implementation)
- **OpenAI TTS** (Echo voice, tts-1 model)
- **ElevenLabs TTS** (Aria voice)
- **Tiro.is TTS** (Attempted with multiple voices, but API returned errors)
- **Azure TTS** (Failed with authentication errors)

### Performance Results

| Service | Sample | Processing Time | File Size | Audio Quality |
|---------|--------|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| Improved Local TTS | Short | 4.50s | 3.59 KB | Basic |
| OpenAI TTS | Short | 6.08s | 78.75 KB | High |
| ElevenLabs TTS | Short | 3.50s | 86.12 KB | High |
| Improved Local TTS | Medium | 3.41s | 4.20 KB | Basic |
| OpenAI TTS | Medium | 3.75s | 198.75 KB | High |
| ElevenLabs TTS | Medium | 3.46s | 228.57 KB | High |
| Improved Local TTS | Podcast | 5.83s | 1.75 KB | Basic |
| OpenAI TTS | Podcast | 3.23s | 267.19 KB | High |
| ElevenLabs TTS | Podcast | 4.41s | 302.45 KB | High |

### Key Findings

1. **OpenAI's TTS** produces high-quality audio with moderate file sizes
2. **ElevenLabs TTS** offers excellent quality with comparable processing times to OpenAI
3. **Local TTS** is most efficient for basic needs with very small file sizes
4. **Azure TTS** still needs proper authentication credentials to be tested

## STT (Speech-to-Text) Comparison Results

We tested speech recognition on a 2-minute sample of Icelandic audio:

### Services Tested

- **OpenAI Whisper** (whisper-1 model)
- **Azure Speech Services** (Failed to produce results)
- **ElevenLabs Scribe** (Failed with API errors)

### Performance Results

| Service | Audio Length | Processing Time | Accuracy |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| OpenAI Whisper | 2 minutes | 14.67s | Moderate |

### Key Findings

1. **OpenAI Whisper** successfully transcribed Icelandic audio with moderate accuracy
2. **Azure Speech Services** did not produce results, possibly due to configuration issues
3. **ElevenLabs Scribe** failed with API errors

## Recommendations

1. For **Text-to-Speech**:
   - Use **ElevenLabs TTS** for best overall combination of quality, speed, and Icelandic pronunciation
   - Use **OpenAI TTS** as a good alternative for high-quality audio with slightly smaller file sizes
   - Use **Local TTS** solution when efficiency and minimal file size are critical

2. For **Speech-to-Text**:
   - **OpenAI Whisper** is currently the most reliable option for Icelandic recognition
   - ElevenLabs Scribe had connection issues that need to be resolved
   - Further testing with proper Azure credentials would be valuable for comparison

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Update Azure API credentials to complete the comparison
   - Investigate ElevenLabs Scribe SSL connection issues
   - Obtain proper API access for Tiro.is (specialized Icelandic service)
   - Integrate ElevenLabs TTS and OpenAI Whisper into the real-time chat system as the preferred services
